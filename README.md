============

My solution to a Gist problem requested as a technical quiz

# MathGistRubyProgram.rb

#Write a function that interprets and evaluates strings 
#in the form of basic arithmetic expressions. 
#You should obey the basic order of operations, that is, 
#multiplication and division come before 
#addition and subtraction, and execute operations 
#from left to right. 
#Return results as a floating point number.

#You can expect all the inputs to be valid and 
#limited to the following character set: 
#(tokens separated by spaces):

# 0-9 + - * /

#For example, a simple input would be: "1 + 1" 
#Returns: 2

#A complex example: "10 + 2 * 3 / 4" 
#Returns: 11.5

#Write your solution in Ruby, JavaScript, or CoffeeScript, without the use of eval
# or similar techniques.

#Please optimize for code readability and clarity. 
#What would your solution look like if it was submitted to 
#part of an open-source library?
#Include some test cases that hit all the edge cases 
#of the valid input space
